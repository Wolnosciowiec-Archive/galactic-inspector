Proxy / Hidden monitoring service
=================================

Hiding the service in the internet is a one of the coolest features that *Galactic Inspector* offers in comparison to other monitoring software.
The feature was implemented with considering the anarchist organizations needs - a hidden, secure monitoring service that no any government can censor.

----------

*Galactic Inspector* can be installed anywhere, on some VPS or dedicated server, hidden somewhere on the NAT network on a Raspberry Pi, or in other place.
The SOCKS proxy can be used to make connections from *Galactic Inspector* to the internet, so all SSH connections, all Slack/Mattermost notifications can be sent
via eg. TOR network. Nobody can know where this came from!
